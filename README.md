# Deep Learning Project For Handwriting Recognition (Digits 0-9)

<img src = 'https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.explicit.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Ft2rLuO82eItlvJn5HOi9AHaEg%26pid%3DApi&f=1'>


# The Task
<p>The system has to "learn" to distinguish and recognize samples of handwritten digits from the popular (and historical) <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database'>MNIST database</a>.</p>

# The Data
The data consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing pictures and is being loaded here directly from <a href = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz'>https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz</a>.

  
# Used Languages and Libraries
<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
</ul>  
  
# Results
The digits are recognized by a rate of 100% with Callback, EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint!
